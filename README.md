# Greenfoot-Typing-Game

This is a game I created in java, using Greenfoot IDE. This is a typing game, you need to type the word that shows up on the screen, backspace if you made a mistake. 

Everytime you type a word correctly, the player will shot a bullet at the closest zombie. The game ends when you type incorrect 10 times, or a zombie reaches the player.
